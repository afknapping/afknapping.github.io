# About Write Forward


Write forward is a writing app inducing flow and focus. It does so by forcing you to write in “hemingway mode” — that is, you can *only* write forward. No editing, no correcting, no inserting.

There two benefits in forcing yourself to work this way:

1. you train yourself to silence the inner critic, who is constantly sending doubts and critique on the *what*-level
2. you train yourself to silence the inner perfectionist, who is constantly sending doubts and critique on the *how*-level

There are several other tools out there that do this. However, most of them do much more and also cost money. So I built something simple that does one thing well, just the way I need it.

I use write forward every day for work and private writing.
