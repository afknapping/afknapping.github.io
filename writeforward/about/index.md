# About Write Forward


**Write forward is a writing app inducing flow and focus.**

It forces you to write in “[Hemingway mode](https://www.google.com/search?q=Hemingway%20mode)” — that is, you can *only* write forward. No editing, no correcting, no inserting.

## Why?

There are two benefits in forcing yourself to write this way:

1. you train yourself to silence the inner critic, who is constantly sending doubts and critique on the *what*-level
2. you train yourself to silence the inner perfectionist, who is constantly sending doubts and critique on the *how*-level


## Features

- Fullscreen mode
- Wordcount
- Uses localstorage – nothing gets lost when reloading the page (use "restore")
- restore as undo for buffer clearing (once you write something, restore is no longer possible)
- "Copy" copies the whole buffer into the clipboard so you can archive or save it in your favourite note taking app
