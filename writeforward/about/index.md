# About Write Forward


**Write forward is a writing app inducing flow and focus.** It does so by forcing you to write in “[Hemingway mode](https://www.google.com/search?q=Hemingway%20mode)” — that is, you can *only* write forward. No editing, no correcting, no inserting.

There are two benefits in forcing yourself to work this way:

1. you train yourself to silence the inner critic, who is constantly sending doubts and critique on the *what*-level
2. you train yourself to silence the inner perfectionist, who is constantly sending doubts and critique on the *how*-level

There are several other tools out there that do this. However, most of them do much more and also cost money. So I built something simple that does one thing well, just the way I need it.

I use write forward every day for work and private writing.

**Features:**
- Pure Hemingway-mode-only writing app – no deleting or editing possible
- Fullscreen mode for the classic "distraction-free writing environment"
- Wordcount
- Uses localstorage as buffer – nothing gets lost when reloading the page
- one-time restoration possibility after clearing the buffer (once you write something, restore is no longer possible)
- "Copy" copies the whole buffer into the clipboard so you can archive or save it in your favourite note taking app
