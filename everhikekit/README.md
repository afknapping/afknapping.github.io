# The EverHike Kit™

Carrying theses things allows one to do a spontanous day hike at any time

- Shoes (if needed plus socks)
- Walking pants (shorts in my case)
- Shirt (team sunhoodie)
- Empty smart bottles or similar for 2l of drinking water
- Snackbag (I use loose nuts and berries – don't do bars, they create ridiculous amounts of trash)
- [Shaker](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Protein-Function-Infusion-Strainer-Quality/dp/B0851F3QDZ/) or other screw top jar with two portions of MagicPowerPorridge™ and spoon
- Wind/Rain jacket
- Wind/Rain pants
- MedKit
- Giddybag – all the small stuffs that you want to have on you when being in nature
- [Packliner](https://www.litesmith.com/nylofume-pack-liner-bags/) – any large enough, high density trash bag will do
- PoopKit – usually a [Trowel](https://www.lowergear.com/backpacking-trowel-for-backpacking-sanitation), biodegradable wetwipes and hand sanitiser

When you feel like taking a hike, just change, fill up the water bottles and cold-soak a porridge for the first break.

> But isn't carrying all that stuff around kinda heavy?

When you go overnight, your pack is *way* heavier. So carrying this stuff around is no big deal. In the long term you want to be able to carry overnight gear and lots of food for many weeks at a time. All training is welcome.
