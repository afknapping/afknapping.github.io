# The EverHike Kit™

Carrying theses things allows one to do a spontanous day hike at any time

- Shoes (if needed plus socks)
- Walking pants (shorts in my case)
- Shirt (am team sunhoodie)
- Snackbag (I use loose nuts and berries – don't do bars, they create a ridiculous amount of trash)
- [Shaker](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Protein-Function-Infusion-Strainer-Quality/dp/B0851F3QDZ/) (or other screw top jar) with two portions of MagicPowerPorridge™ and spoon
- Wind/Rain jacket
- Wind/Rain pants
- MedKit
- Giddybag (all the small stuffs that you want to have on you when being in nature)
- [Packliner](https://www.litesmith.com/nylofume-pack-liner-bags/) (any large, high density trash bag will do)

> But isn't carrying all that stuff around kinda heavy?

When you go overnight, your pack is way heavier. So carrying this stuff around is no big deal. In the long term you want to be able to carry overnight gear and lots of food for many weeks at a time. All training is welcome.
