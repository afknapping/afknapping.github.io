# The gate between heaven and hell

Dear kids.

A lot of times these days it feels like all the gates to hell are opening ever wider.

Gene modification of food, men and women. Mandated medical treatments that cause enounormous damage and suffering. Cartels and corruption make up 80% of everything. Microplastic is in our bloddstreams. The Metaverse shite and direct-to-brain, bluetooth chip implants. De-humanisation by transhumanism. Surveillance. Control."Natural Asset Companies". Cities as traded stock corporations. Captured media and institutions. Large scale human trafficking and sexual exploitation. Ritual child abuse. "Public Relations" and other forms of mind control.

I could go on. For some people the world is nothing but a chess board.

It all invites regularly to say something like "the gate to hell is wide open".

But it is not just a gate into hell. It is the gate that separates heaven and hell.

We cross that gate may times a day, mostly unconscious or aware. Every second you chose.

A lot of hell is disguised and marketed to us. A lot of hell we simply don't want to know â€“ it's so much more convenient to call it disinformation and vilify the people doing what was once called investigative journalism.

A lot of heaven is disguised, distorted, veiled. It takes effort to see it. You finding pieces of heaven is not on the agenda of powerful people. You have to do that work yourself. Listen. Read. Observe. Experience. Experiment.

I urge you to do that. Listen, read, ovbserve, experience, experiment. LROEE, not a greeat acronym.

The more you listen, the more you will be able to hear your core, your soul, your actual self that is usually drowned by all the noise from ego, personality, identity, mind and hormones. When you listen close enough and long enough, intuition is what it gives you.

Your intituition is always the right way. It rarely leads you where you wanted to go. It always leads to the right place., the right people, the right experiences, the tright things. You If you follow your intuition you will arrive at a places of peace. The endless stream fof being driven and hungry dissolves for islands of peace. Some take days, some take decades.

Over time, these islands of piece grow larger. They grow together and form land. And one day you live in a land of peace.

Your self below the layers has a direct connection to source. Intuition is your channel to source. Tune in.

And follow that white rabbit.
